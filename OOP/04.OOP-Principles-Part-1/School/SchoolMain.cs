//Problem 1. School classes

//We are given a school. In the school there are classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers. Each teacher teaches, a set 
//of disciplines. Students have a name and unique class number. Classes have unique text identifier. Teachers have a name. Disciplines
//have a name, number of lectures and number of exercises. Both teachers and students are people. Students, classes, teachers and 
//disciplines could have optional comments (free text block).
//Your task is to identify the classes (in terms of OOP) and their attributes and operations, encapsulate their fields, define the 
//class hierarchy and create a class diagram with Visual Studio.
